### time-lapse of a salamander
- Cell Division
- Cell Movement (morphogenesis)
- cells take on "specific" fates (differentiation)
- Inductive Signals: transplanted tissue to surrounding cells

Master Regulatory Genes:
- Coordinate control
- May self-stimulate production
- Produce transcription factors for differentiation
- Can often change other fully differentiated cells into their own type
