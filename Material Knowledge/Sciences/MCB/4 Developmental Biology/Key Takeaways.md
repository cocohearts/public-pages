- Inductive signalling (signal gets passed down)
- Cell Signaling:
	- Ligand binds to receptor (signal reception)
	- Intracellular signal transduction (exponential protein copying)
	- Cell response
- Combinatorial control (small number of factors controlling large # genes)
	- Complex stripy patterns in (embryo?)
- HOX genes define "body segments," these r huge master regulatory genes
