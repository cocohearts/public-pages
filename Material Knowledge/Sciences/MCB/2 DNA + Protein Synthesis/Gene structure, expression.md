### Gene Expression
- 5' to 3' on top, "coding"; 3' to 5' on bottom, "template"
- Polymerase acts on the template, promoters tell polymerase where to bind
- TATA box in the promoter
- Many transcription factors interacting with promoter, allowing for actual gene expression

### Post *Transcription*
- Certain substrings denote ends of introns, exon
![[Pasted image 20231107144818.png]]
- Introns get spliced out by *spliceosomes,* a mix of polypeptides and RNA that identify *splice sites*
- Then *guanine* added to 5' side, poly-A tails of *adenine*s to 3' side
- Tail protects from degradation

### Translation
- *Ribosome* builds proteins from mRNA
- In general "ribozymes" or proteins that contain RNA (portm. ribo-, enzyme)
