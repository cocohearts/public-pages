- tRNA binds to mRNA carrying amino acids
- mRNA has start codon, end codon, that's where ribosome works
- Codon wheel translates nucleotides into amino acids
- Amino acids attached to tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthethase
	- Checks that the amino acid matches anticodon
	- One for each amino acid
- Initiation, Elongation, Termination
- Initiator Methionine
- "intiation complex"
- for tRNA:
	- A site has mRNA nucleotides paired, in opposite order
	- AUG are STOP codons (anticodon CAU)
	- UAG, UAA, UGA are STOP codons (anticodons CUA, UUA, UCA)
	- Nucleotides covalently bonded to tRNA
	- Slots are E, P, A
	- New tRNA steps in A, then mRNA chain moves, E breaks off
	- Release factor fits into P site for STOP
