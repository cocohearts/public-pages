- In bact., genes (1 protein each) can be promoted together, called *operon* (e.g. pathway to make tryptophan)
- Operator (transcription binding region)
- Regulatory gene builds repressor
- With tryptophan in environment, repressor binds to operator, repressing it
- Coordinatedly controlled genes have same control elements (binding regions)

- Anabolic pathway: build stuff (=ON) (repressor=OFF) repressible
	- e.g. building tryptophan without trp in environ, negative control only
- Catabolic pathway: build enzymes to break stuff (=OFF) (repressor=ON) inducible
	- e.g. breaking down lactose with lactate if lactose in environ, negative control no lactose, positive control if no glucose

- Negative control through repressor (lack/presence controls repressor in both ways)
- Positive control through activator (lack/presence controls regulatory protein, must bind to activator)

- Control elements are pieces that control regulation
	- Enhancer is a region made up of distal control elements, genes coding for proteins that control activators, increasing transcription
	- Proximal control elements are controlled by repressors, decreasing transcription
