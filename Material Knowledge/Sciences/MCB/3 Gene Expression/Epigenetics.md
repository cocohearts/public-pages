"Second genome" on top of the genome that modifies expression
- Chromatin (rolled up structure) can be another variable in gene expression
- Histone Modifications
	- Histones are the protein balls DNA wrap around; DNA negative, histones positive
	- Acetylation tail -> open DNA (euchromatin), neutralizes lysine positive charge on histone
	- Methylation tail -> compact DNA, more permanent shutoff (heterochromatin)
		- Hereditary (each daughter has half strand, update afterwards)
	- Both -> reversible enzyme-catalyzed chemical rxns
