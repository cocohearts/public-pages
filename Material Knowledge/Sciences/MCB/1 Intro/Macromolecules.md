- *Proteins* composed of amino acids
	- Serve as enzymes, hormones, storage, motor, structure, receptor, transport, defense
	- Most important function as catalytic enzyme, allowing reactions to happen, acting as workhorse
	 - Amino acid is *alpha* C attached to H, Amino (NH<sub>2</sub>), Carboxyl (COOH) and R group
	 - C-terminus (last carboxyl) and N-terminus (last amino)
	 - Nonpolar R groups result in hydrophobic, polar/partially ionized R groups result in hydrophilic
	 - Peptide bonds dehydration bond amino to carboxyl
	 - Folding happens spontaneously when polypeptide formed
	 - Four levels of structure:
		 - Primary: peptides in the chain
		 - Secondary: hydrogen bonding within the chain that self-stabilizes, particularly into *alpha-helices* and *beta-sheets*
		 - Tertiary: Further self-stabilization with additional side chains, with disulfide bridges
		 - Quaternary (Epic only): Two or more polypeptides together, with disulfide bridges, H/dispersion forces
	 - Denaturation, from chemical or heat input
	 - X-ray crystallagraphy used to read protein shape
- *Carbohydrates* molecules that are equal numbers of carbon and hydrogen
	- E.g. CH<sub>2</sub>O
	- Glucose is 6 of these arrange in a ring
		- Except one ring node replaced with an O, other "piece" moved onto node adjacent to O
		- Carbons in ring are numbered 1-6 starting from O, ending on moved piece
	- Cellulose is glucoses attached in alternating style
	- Starch is glucoses attached 1-4 in direct style
	- Glycogen is direct starch-like bonds with strange complex branches
- *Nucleic Acid* molecules such as RNA, DNA composed of nucleotides
	- Ribose Nucleic Acid (Ribose is a sugar)
	- Deoxy (no oxygen in the ribose) Ribose Nucleic Acid
	- Bonds are called "phosphodiester"
	- Polynucleotide/nucleic acid, ribosomes create proteins formed from amino acids informed by mRNA formed from DNA
	- Nucleotide structure
		- Sugar (ribose or 2-deoxyribose)
		- Nitrogenous group (purine, A or G, vs pyrimidine, C, G, or U \[RNA only])
		- A-T, G-C
		- Some number of phosphate groups
	- Ends indexed by (start) phosphate+5' to (end) 3'
	- Double helix held together by hydrogen bonding
- *Lipids* are not polymers; fats or steroids
	- Fats often have glycerol membrane with fatty acids (carbon-hydrogen chains)
	- If carbons are double-bonded, chain is *bent* and fats cannot pack tightly (unsaturated, liquid)
	- Otherwise all single-bonded, chain is *straight* and fats pack tightly (saturated, solid)
	- Phospholipids have two fatty acids and one phosphate group
