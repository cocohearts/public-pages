$$C_6H_{12}O_6\implies 6CO_2+6H_2O+E$$
$$6CO_2+12H_2O+P \implies C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6H_2O$$
$O_2$ becomes reduced (gain electron) to become $H_2O,$ and vice versa (oxidized to lose)

Light hits chlorophyll, excited electron in chlorophyll that gets transferred through redox

After PSII, *cytochrome complex* splits water and creates proton gradient. NADPH is final electron acceptor.
