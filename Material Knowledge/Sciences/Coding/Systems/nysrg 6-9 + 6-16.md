care about ACID, atomicity (transactions don't complete partially), consistency (always correct), isolation (txs don't inteerfere with each other), durability (data put now is there later)

FoundationDB: a "simple" "minimalistic" key-value store that first built in 2009, Apple acquired, open-sourced in 2021

distributed database

![[Pasted image 20240616144010.png]]
client talks to proxy, asking for a read-only snapshot, proxy returns read version
e.g. tx A has rv 100, tx B has rv 101, then tx A will receive commit version 102 i.e. at v102 tx A's thing would be "done"

there's a resolver that figures out what conflicts exist and what commit time is OK
keeps a hybrid clock of some kind
e.g. if tx B,C,D use rv 102, 103, 104, then tx A gets cv 105

actually scratch that
client asks proxy for rv. greater than any previous issued cv
then goes and asks storage system (through ls through proxy) for certain reads at that rv
finally submits read/write sets to proxy, proxy asks sequencer for a commit version

in ekzhang's head:
- coordinators form a distributed quorum storing config, control, etc.
- delegate a sequencer, ratekeeper, data distributor (?)
