### Chap 6 
12m
- Light/electron microscopes; bend/reflect photons/electrons to see stuff inside cell
- Plasma membranes, phopholipid bilayers;  Prokaryotes don't have organelles, eukeryotes do
	- DNA in nucleus, implemented by ribosomes
	- soft ER creates lipids, detoxifies
	- Rough ER takes mRNA, makes proteins in a vesicle, transports to Golgi for packing; also makes membrane
	- Golgi synthesizes, sorts
- Lysosome contains digestive enzymes
- Mitochondria, chloroplasts also do things
- Cytoskeleton does structural work, microfibers; transport proteins "walk" with ATP along microtubules carrying stuff
- Plant cell walls from cellulose fibers knitted; animal cells have collagen
### Chap 7 
- Cellular membrane is rapidly moving bilayer interspersed with proteins and other junk
- Proteins mediate what can cross
- Diffusion allows for passive transport along electric/chemical gradients
- Level of water in environ is important; mediated by aquaporins
- Pumps can create electric/chemical gradients, by ATP
- "cotransport"; pump creates gradient, which is then used to collect outside stuff
- Exocytosis (send stuff out), endocytosis (bring stuff in) for bulk transport
### Chap 8
- Metabolism through *catabolic* (breaks down) or *anabolic* (builds)
- Gibbs free energy = H - T\*S, energy, temp, entropy resp., must be decreasing for reaction to be spontaneous
- ATP releases inorganic phosphate group, phosphorylates, changes protein shape -> does work
- Enzymes control the "hump" of the free-energy chemical reaction graph
- Regulation through binding to enzymes/deactivating them (e.g. feedback), or just by enzymes being separated
### Chap 9
- Start with glucose, use two NADP+ to change into NADPH, break into two pyruvates, also two ATP
- Pyruvates into Acetyl CoA through citric acid cycle, output mostly NADPH
- via oxidative phosphorylation there's an H+ pump that turns a motor that turns ADP into ATP, via electronegativity decrease ladder ending at O_2 to H2O
- Fermentation returns NADPH to NADP+, via lactic acid or alcohol, skips oxidative phosphorylation
- Fermentation/anaerobic is 16 times less efficient than aerobic
- All other macromolecules feed into this system, maybe skip glycolysis
### Chap 10
- Light hits chlorophyll, excites electron
- Like relay, electron gets passed around until hits one chlorophyll, excited electron transferred to "primary electron acceptor", produces ATP
- Secondary photosystem then creates NADPH asw
- Finally Calvin cycle uses carbon fixation, reduction, and regeneration to create G3P (three carbon sugar)
- There are also other mechanisms
- Chloroplast organelle is called *plastid*
### Chap 11
- Long-distance signaling via hormones, or short-distance via short-lived signalling molecules or direct interfacing
- A *kinase* is smth that initiates phosphorylation of a protein with ATP, activating it
- Ligand binds with bigger receptor, changing shape, releasing/causing phosphorylation
	- Receptor activates G protein, doing smth
	- Ion channels opened by ligands, allow ions into cytoplasm
- Phosphorylation is widespread activation action, with large *cascades* from exponential chains
- Internal cell signalling can include ions, small molecules, e.g. Ca ions are much lower in cytoplasm than in blood, release from ER can signal stuff
- Apoptosis is controlled by multiple streams, signals, DNA damage, protein misfolding, results in blebs that are "cleaned up"
### Chap 12
- Genome split into 23 chromosomes, along with wrapper called chromatin. Gametes are half-DNA cells; rest are called somatic
- Eukaryotic animal/plant cells have *mitosis*, a spindle is created that attaches to chromosomes, pulling in half, while cell is stretched by microtubules
- Chromosomes split; mitosis has five stages; last one combined with "cytokinesis," new membrane forming and two cells moving apart
- Cell cycle control as checkpoints, usually at end of G1 before chromatid doubling; if failed checkpoint, cell goes to G0 usually
- Cancer if cycle control is broken; *metastasis* is cells moving to other parts of the body
