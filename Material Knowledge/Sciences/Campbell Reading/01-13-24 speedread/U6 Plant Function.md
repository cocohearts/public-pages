### Chap 35
- Organs, tissues, cells
- Stems, leaves, flowers
	- Apical (apex) bud vs axillary (side) bud
	- Branch points are called *nodes*, in-between *internode*
- Dermal (skin), Vascular (carry water, nutrients), Ground (other stuff)
- Xylem (water), Phloem (nutrients) constitute *vascular*
- *Parenchyma* undifferentiated, synthesis/storage
- *Collenchyma* support young parts
- *Sclerenchyma* have thick walls
- *Tracheids, vessel elements* are dead but carry water
- *Sieve-tube elements*, devoid of organelles, transport sugar
- *Primary growth* elongates, *Secondary growth* widens
- *Meristem*, undifferentiated tissue; *vascular cambium* produces secondary xylem/phloem; *cork cambium* provides covering for woody plants
### Chap 36
- Recall *plasmodesmata*, thin cytoplasm between adjacent plant cells
- Fungal hyphae indirectly offer larger surface area for roots
- *Apoplast,* outside plasma membranes; *symplast*, inside
- Passive osmosis/respiration moves water up, *cohesion-tension hypothesis*
- *Wilting* is water lost from transpiration not being replaced
- Stomata can be closed; controlled by light, CO2, drought hormone *abscisic acid*, circadian
- Sucrose cotransported with H+, moved with proton pumps
- Symplast can be regulated dynamically
### Chap 37
- Soil has several layers; topsoil is what we care about, composed of sand, silt, clay, optimally equal parts
- A lot is of topsoil is *humus,* aka dead stuff
- Hope is to hold equal parts air/water, and water is saturated with minerals
- Macronutrients include C,O,H,N, plus some other stuff
- *Rhizosphere* is soil near the roots; rhizobacteria+others live symbiotically with plants
- Only bacteria can "fixate" nitrogen, i.e. N2->HN3, done anaerobically with dead materials
- Legumes can be "infected" by rhizobacteria, replenishing soil nitrogen -> crop rotation
- *Mycorrhizae* is hyphae on plant roots
### Chap 38
- Angiosperm, like mosses, have *gametophyte* alternate generations; gametophyte is the flower, composed of
	- Sepals, bud protection
	- Petals
	- Stamens, the sticks bearing anthers where microspores become pollen grains
	- Carpels, the embryos
- *Double fertilization* where one becomes zygote, other becomes food-storing endosperm
- Many features to *avoid* self-fertilization
### Chap 39
- Signal transduction as before, with second messengers, mostly Ca2+
- ==Hormones== control plant growth
	- Auxin: stimulates elongation; regulates bending, produced at apex
	- Cytokinins, stimulates division; promotes later bud growth
	- Gibberellins: promotes stem elongation, helps seeds break dormancy
	- Abscisic acid: (abscission of leaves) closes stoma, keeps seed dormant
	- Ethylene: creates *triple response*, plant begins "changing direction"
- Light responses are critical; shoot begins greening (de-etiolation) as soon as light is encountered
