### Chap 2
- Uusal atomic chem, protons/neutrons/electrons/P table
- bond types, bond shapes
- molecular structure -> function
### Chap 3
- Water is important, has much volume on Earth
- Hydrogen bonds lead to
	- High heat capacity
	- Adhesion
	- Floating ice
	- Solvency
- Water permits acids/bases, note buffer solutions, pairing of weak acid/corresponding base, v/versa
### Chap 4
- Carbons r backbone, 4 valence allows for varied structure
- Isomers:
	- *structural*,
	- *cis-trans* (angle of alignment),
	- *enantiomer* (symmetry)
- Some *functional groups* and *chemical groups* are key to remember
### Chap 5
- Macromolecules are made from polymers, except proteins
- Lipids: fats are glycerol with fatty acids, can have sat/unsat/trans
- Carbs: sugars are single-bonded C chains, usually H-C-O-H, can have multiple *saccharides*in a chain
- Proteins: amino acids with C, Amino group, Carboxyl group, and Functional group
	- linear amino structure, secondary helices/sheets, tertiary disulfide chains/hydrophobic interactions, quaternary polypeptide interactions
- Nucleic acids
	- Sugar/phosphate backbone chain
	- Double helix
