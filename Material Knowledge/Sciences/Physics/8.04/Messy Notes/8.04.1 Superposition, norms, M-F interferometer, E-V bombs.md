While physical theories have not been made compatible, quantum mechanics is a framework for operating on other fields, such as classical mechanics and EM.

One nice thing is linearity; the time evolution operator $\hat H$ in Schrodinger's is assumed to be linear, so solutions are all linear. This operator is somewhat arbitrary, by the way.

States superimpose linearly, we can represent them as vectors in some abstract $\mathbb C$-valued vector space, and if outcomes are finite we can represent as a unit vector in $\CC^k$. Then the probability of any event is the norm of its coefficient. Because of this, *states are invariant on constant scaling*.

Also recall entanglement; we can use $\otimes$ to denote one outcome with several measurements; if two measurements are not independent in some state, they're entangled.

Let's examine one case study: the *Mach-Zehnder interferometer*.

Represent photon states with unit $\CC^2$ column vectors.

The splitters are probabilistic, they split one way vs the other with amplitudes $s,t$ satisfying $s^2+t^2=1.$ But that's only from one direction; it can also split differently depending on input from the other direction. Then each BS is a $2\times 2$ complex matrix. It must also be an orthogonal matrix.

Considering two "correct" orthogonal matrices with $\frac1{\sqrt 2},$ their product is actually $\begin{bmatrix} 0&1\\-1&0\end{bmatrix}.$ Then in this above setup where the initial state is all from bottom, it will end up all going to detector 0, the top.

We can use this to get some "uncanny measurement" in an EV bomb. If we stick a bomb in the bottom path between the two splitters, and the detector *does* work, then it is $50\%$ a photon ends at D1, and independently $50\%$ a photon goes through the top path. Then given a live bomb, with $25\%$ probability we discover that it is live without setting it off.

Final note: *phase shifters* work by multiplying the probability amplitude by $e^{i\delta}.$ No clue why this works.
