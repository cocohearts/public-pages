The step potential is $0$ for $x<0,$ $V_0$ for $x>0$. Take a functional or whatever if you prefer.

Once again we've got piecewise constant potentials, which is just linear combinations of exponentials. Specifically, with $k^2=\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}, \bar k^2=\frac{2m(E-V_0)}{\hbar^2},$ we have $\Psi=Ae^{ikx}+Be^{-ikx}$ for $x<0,$ $C e^{i\bar kx}$ for $x>0.$

Once again analyzing continuity of $\psi$ and $\psi'$ at $x=0$ we can solve for $A,B,C$ in terms of $k,\bar k.$ With $E<V_0$ we get imaginary $\bar k$ resulting in a decaying exponential in forbidden region, and some ghastly phase-shifted sine for $x<0.$

The time factor is $e^{iEt/\hbar}.$ Then with the energy eigenstate we can compose these states into a normalizable wavepacket. The three terms corresponding to $A,B,C$ are like the incident, reflected, and transmitted wave.

Using the stationary phase paradigm we can determine the speed of the wavepacket components. 

For $E>V_0$ the incoming and reflected both have speed $\frac{\hbar k_0}{m}$ and reflected has speed $\frac{\hbar \bar k_0}m.$ 

For $E<V_0$ the observed phase shift in the sine because a *time delay* in the reflected component.

Finally, a funny heuristic argument:
Suppose we saw a particle in the forbidden region. Then because of the decaying exponential it's about $\frac1k,$ where $\kappa^2=\frac{2m(V_0-E)}{\hbar^2}$, of the way in. The position uncertainty must be at most $\kappa,$ so $p\geq\frac{\hbar}{\nabla x}=\hbar\kappa.$ Then this new momentum contributes to an amount of energy
$\frac{p^2}{2m}=\frac{\hbar^2\kappa^2}{2m}=V_0-E,$ so the final energy is in fact at least $V_0$ probably.
