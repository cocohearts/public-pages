More analysis of solving 1D potentials.

- Dirac Delta is a "function" (actually it's a functional) that satisfies ...

- Node Theorem: the *n*th lowest-energy bound state has $n-1$ nodes, for $\lim_{x\to\infty}V=\infty$.
- Proof: Take an infinitesimally thin "screen" outside of which everything is 0. Then we get $n-1$ nodes for the $n$th state, because that's just square well, but infinitesimal. 
- Then as we stretch the screen out, the $n$th state can never gain more nodes. At the endpoints of the screen we have $\psi=0$ and so the sign of $\psi'$ at those endpoints can't change. 
- Also we can't have a "double node" getting created; if the wavefunction is tangent to the $x$-axis then $\psi=\psi'=0\implies\psi\equiv 0.$ 
- Done!

Harmonic Oscillator: $V(x)=\frac 12m\omega^2 x^2.$ To solve this, we nondimensionalize the usual eigenstate equation to
$$\frac{d^2\varphi}{du^2}=(u^2-\mathcal E)\varphi.$$
Substituting $\varphi=e^{\frac{-x^2}2}h$ is completely motivated, and after doing that we can solve for $h$ as some finite-degree polynomial. Tada!
