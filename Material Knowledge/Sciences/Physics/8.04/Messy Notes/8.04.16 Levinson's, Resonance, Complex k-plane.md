Context here: we're dealing just with the infinite wall, incoming wave, 1D potential thing.
### Levinson's
What's the number of (countable) bound states for a potential? (Recall scattering states are infinite.) Let's take a second infinite wall whose distance $L$ limits to $\infty$. We have $V$ which ends at $R$.

Consider $V=0,$ then we got $\sin(kx)$ coming in, the second wall creates $kL=n\pi.$ Then for infinitesimal interval $dk$ we got $dn=\frac L\pi dk$ possibilities for $n$.

For $V\neq 0,$ we got $e^{i\delta}\sin(kx+\delta)$ coming in, so BC yields $kL+\delta=n'\pi.$ Then same thing, $Ldk+\frac{d\delta}{d k}dk=\pi dn'.$ Then $dn'=\frac L\pi dk + \frac1\pi \frac{d\delta}{dk}dk,$ so turning on $V$ costs us $dn-dn'=-\frac1\pi\frac{d\delta}{dk}dk$ bound states, over the interval $dk$. Then integrating over all $k$, we get a loss of $\frac 1\pi (\delta(0)-\delta(\infty)).$ 

But as we slowly turn on $V$ we can't lose states, so all of these "lost" states become negative energy -> bound states! thonk.

### Modeling Resonance
Clearly $E\in (0,V_1).$ We want resonant, i.e. large amplitude in potential and large time delay.

Recall $\Delta t=\frac{d\delta}{dE},$ or something. We get bumps when $\delta$ crosses $\frac{n\pi}2,$ cuz that's when stuff is "resonant," I suppose. Waves matching with each other.

Let's have a double-step potential, $V=-V_0$ for $x<a,$ $V=V_1$ for $x<2a,$ $V=0$ otherwise. Solve with a cute trick using $\cosh(x-a),\sinh(x-a)$ in the middle interval.

We want large resonance, so we want $\delta$ to quickly cross from $0$ to $\pi$, so large derivative at $\delta=\frac\pi 2$. We can achieve this with

$$\delta=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\alpha\varepsilon}{\alpha-k}\right).$$
Using $\beta=\alpha\varepsilon,$

We then calculate $\Delta t\sim \frac1\beta$ (using $\frac{d\delta}{dk}$ as heuristic) and our amplitude heuristic $|\psi_s|^2=\sin\delta^2=\frac{\beta^2}{\beta^2+(\alpha-k)^2}.$
At $k\sim \alpha,$  we get $|\psi_s|^2=\frac{\frac14\Gamma^2}{(E-E_\alpha)^2+\frac14\Gamma^2}$ where $\Gamma=\frac{2\alpha\beta\hbar^2}{m}.$ Here $\psi_s$ is basically a measure of scattering resonance sm.

$\Gamma$ is a measure of the width of the distribution of the wavefunction amplitude in the potential as a function of $k$.

Taking the time $\tau=\frac\hbar\Gamma,$ we can evaluate $\Delta t=4\tau.$

Let's go a little wild. Take the $x>R$ wavefunction $e^{i\delta}\sin(kx+\delta),$ so we care about $A_s=e^{i\delta}\sin\delta.$ $A_s$ here is scattering amplitude.
Then $A_s=\frac{\tan\delta}{1-i\tan\delta}.$ 

So weirdly enough we'd like $\tan\delta=-i.$ Notice that our $|A_s|=1$ from earlier is just the best we can do with real $\delta$, $\delta\to\frac\pi 2,$ i.e. $\tan\delta\to\infty.$

Now, continuing with our weird example...

If we sub stuff back in we get
$A_s=\frac{\frac{\beta}{\alpha-k}}{1-i\frac{\beta}{\alpha-k}}=\frac{\beta}{(a-i\beta)-k}.$ Then we want $k$ to be as close to $a-i\beta$ as possible. If we allow complex $k$... we get arbitrarily big resonance at $\tan(\delta(k))=-i.$ Here, the imaginary part $\beta$ refers us to the half-life (somehow, didnt get to that,) and the positive-imaginary-part poles refer us to the bound states! (somehow?? $E\sim k^2<0,$ I suppose)

so goes physics
