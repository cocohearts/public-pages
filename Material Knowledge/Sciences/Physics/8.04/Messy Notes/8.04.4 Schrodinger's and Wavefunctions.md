> [!FAQ] What is the wavefunction?
It's a function returning the *likelihood* of finding a particle in the *neighborhood*. Specifically, $P(\bf x)=|\Psi(x)|^2.$ The Schrodinger equation will, in fact, preserve $\int |\Psi(\bf x)|^2\,d\bf x^3=1.$

In one dimension, at non-relativistic speeds, since the particle is of the form
$$e^{i(kx-\omega t)}$$
and the momentum, energy are $p=\hbar k$ and $E=\hbar\omega=\frac{p^2}{2m},$ we get the operator
$$\hat p=\frac{\hbar}i\frac{\partial}{\partial x}.$$
Then
$$\hat E\Psi=\hbar\omega=i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi,$$
but also $$\hat E\Psi=\frac{p^2}{2m}\Psi=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\Psi.$$
Then we get the

> [!important] Free Particle Schrodinger's Equation
$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\Psi.$$

This holds for all free particles of mass *m* regardless of speed or frequency.

Now if we add a potential energy, we now have $E=\frac{p^2}{2m}+V$ (the first term is kinetic energy). Furthermore we can extend to three dimensions using the Laplacian and *del*, yielding

> [!important] Schrodinger's Equation
Where both $V$ and $\Psi$ are functions of $\textbf{x}$ and $t,$ 
$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi=\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2+V\right)\Psi.$$

Note that this is linear in $\Psi$ and first order in $t$.

We also have the $\hat x=x$ *operator* (basically just an abstract formalization). Then we can compute *commutators* $[\hat A,\hat B]=\hat A\hat B-\hat B\hat A.$ It turns out that $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar.$
