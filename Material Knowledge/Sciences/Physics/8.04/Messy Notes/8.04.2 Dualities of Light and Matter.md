Effectively, everything is both a wave and a particle. Lots of fun.

Formulas:
- Photon energy $E=h\nu$
- ==Compton wavelength is the wavelength for a photon whose *energy* equals the particle's *rest energy*==: $mc^2=h\nu=h\frac c\lambda,$ so $\lambda_C=\frac h{mc}$
- As Compton wavelength is wavelength of photon with the same rest energy, ==de Broglie wavelength is that of photon with the same *momentum*.==
- A matter particle has an approximate *de Broglie* wavelength $\lambda=\frac hp.$
- Relativity momentum: $E^2-p^2c^2=m^2c^4.$ Thus $E=\sqrt{m^2c^4+p^2c^2,}$ and $\Delta E=E-mc^2\approx \frac12{p^2}m$ as expected.
- As a result, momentum and energy both have a $\frac1{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ factor on top of the classical $mc^2$ and $mv$.

Photoelectron scattering is what happens when a photon hits an atom and ionizes it. By classical EM intuition it's just an electron that begins oscillating in a field, but that don't really work for photons at energies higher than potential holding electrons.

- Using relativistic momentum and energy conservation, Compton scattering yields new photon wavelength $\lambda_f=\lambda_i+\lambda_C(1-\cos\theta),$ where $\theta$ is directional angle change and $\lambda_C$ is Compton wavelength for the electron.
