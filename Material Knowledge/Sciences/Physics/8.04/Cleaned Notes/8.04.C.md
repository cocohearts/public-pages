## Unidirectional transmission/scattering
Set up exponential ansatz for each domain and solve BCs.
### Example: Step Potential
Take $$
V=\begin{cases}
0&x<0 \\
V_{0}&x>0
\end{cases}
$$Then we can send an "incoming wave" $\Psi=Ae^{ikx}$ resulting in a reflected wave $Be^{-ikx}$ and a transmitted wave $Ce^{i\bar{k}x}.$ Here $k^{2}=\frac{2mE}{\hbar^{2}}$ and $\bar{k}^{2}=\frac{2m(E-V_{0})}{\hbar^{2}}$.

Given this energy eigenstate we can take a pulse like "wave packet" and take Fourier series, then determine transmitted waves.

In general, stationary phase paradigm can be used to determine location of "hump" of Fourier series, i.e. speed of wavepacket.

For $E>V_{0}$, speeds are calculable. For $E<V_{0}$ reflected has a time delay, and there is no transmitted (only exponential decaying).
### Example: Finite square well, resonance
Suppose we're sending the same wave $Ae^{ikx}$ wave from the left through a finite square well $|x|<a$, then we get the ansatz $Ae^{ikx}+Be^{-ikx}$ for $x<-a,$ $Ce^{ik_2x}+De^{-ik_2x}$ for $|x|<a,$ and $Fe^{ikx}$ for $x>a.$

If the wavenumber $k_{2}$ inside the well resonates with the width of the well $2a$, i.e. if $2k_{2}a=n\pi,$ then we get perfect transmission, and $E+V$ matches the $n$th bound state in the infinite square well.
## Reflective half-domain scattering
Consider infinite wall at $x=0$ and $V=0$ for suff. large $x$. Then send $\Psi=e^{-ikx}$ for the usual $k^{2}=\frac{2mE}{\hbar^{2}}$. With time delay $\delta(k)$ reflection is $e^{ikx+2i\delta}$, so after constant scaling for large $x$ we get $\Psi=\sin(kx+\delta)$.
### Wavepacket $\Delta t$
Devise a generalized function $\delta(k)$ for the time delay, so that $e^{-ikx}$ becomes $e^{ikx+2i\delta(k)}$. After applying stationary phase, time delay of a wavepacket becomes $\Delta t=2\hbar \frac{{\partial}}{\partial E}\delta(k_{0}).$
### Levinson's
Add second infinite wall at $L\to \infty.$ 

For $V=0,$ $kL=n\pi,$ so interval $dk$ has $\frac{L}{\pi}dk=dn$ possible scattering states.

For the $V$ we want, at a distance $\Psi=\sin(kx+\delta)$ so $kL+\delta=n\pi,$ so interval $dk$ has $\frac{L}{\pi}dk+\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{{d\delta}}{dk}dk$ possible scattering states.

Fix $L$. Turning on $V$ continuously/pointwise/whatever cannot change total number of eigenstates. Then turning on $V$ transforms $\frac{1}{\pi}(\delta(0)-\delta(\infty))$ scattering states into bound states, so there are $\frac{1}{\pi}(\delta(0)-\delta(\infty))$ bound states.
### Some weird experimentation/construction
We want to construct arbitrarily long positive time delay (negative violates causality). Then we want high resonance.

Try a double-step negative-positive-zero potential.

Amplitude of trapped area, plot (c), spikes when time delay is near $\frac{\pi}{2}$, which makes sense.

### Weird magic
If we do stuff, e.g. setting $\delta(k)$  we can artificially create high resonance.
