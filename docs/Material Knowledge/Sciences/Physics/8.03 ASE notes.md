Key example:
> Take a 2D rectangular mesh of beads on strings, oscillating laterally. We drop the BCs and extend to infinite planeâ€”the translation is up/down/left/right so we can just do $z(x,y)=e^{i(k_{1}x+k_{2}y)}$ and match up the coefficients.
> 
> The equation looks like $$\ddot{{z(t)}}=\frac{T}{L}\nabla^{2}z(x,y).$$

The $\nabla^{2}$ is the continuous version of a $\begin{bmatrix}1&-2&1\end{bmatrix}$ matrix $K$ representing forces due to neighbors being attached with springs oscillating longitudinally.

In this case we get a (straightforward) $M^{-1}K \frac{\partial^{2}x}{\partial x^{2}}\vec{z}=\dot{z}\dot{},$ with normal modes being represented by $e^{-i\omega t}v$ with $v$ being eigenvector of $M^{-1}K$ with eigenvalue $\omega^{2}$.

Next we have incoming waves, crossing a border and creating a transmitted and reflected wave. Based on tension on the string on the other side/refraction index on the other side/wtv, the wavenumber $k_{2}$ on the other side will be different but reflection wavenumber will be $-k$.

Then we match boundary conditions on the border:
- fixed point: value at 0 is fixed at whatever
- moving loop on rod: values are equal, derivatives are equal
- moving weight: values are equal, delta in derivatives provides force matching $f''(0)$
