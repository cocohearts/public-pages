### Chap 52
- Several parts; climate, abiotic factors
- *Biomes* (specific areas/systems)
- Convection in water bodies across different seasons exists
- *Thermocline* separates uniformly warm from uniformly cold
### Chap 53
- Applied ecological theory: population should increase exponentially, actually logistic growth determines carrying capacity
- Population growth/birth, death rates depend on density; weird DEs
### Chap 54
- Types of food consumers/interactions, energy efficiency etc
- Food webs/chains, species diversity
- Thinking bottom-up (energy flow) vs top-down (population control)
- Successive land/ecosystem transformation, e.g. by nitrogen fixation by plants
### Chap 55
- Energy transfer between trophic levels is ==10%== efficient
- Introduction of a single new species (e.g. foxes eating detritus birds on islands, reducing fertilization) esp. at a higher trophic level can quickly transform ecosystems
- Mass/energy transfer can be accounted
- Plants/fungi are key for reclaiming water, minerals, nutrients; otherwise erosion, soil runoff etc.
- Sometimes people engineer ecosystems by introducing suitable species
### Chap 56
- Biodiversity: genetic -> species -> ecosystem diversity
- *Landscape conservation* tries to main *biodiversity*, *population conservation* tries to maintain above minimum
