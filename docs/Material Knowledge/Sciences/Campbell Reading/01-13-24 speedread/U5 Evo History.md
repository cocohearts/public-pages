### Chap 26
- Linnaean (Linnaeus) naming system: genus + species
- domains -> kingdoms -> phyla -> classes -> orders -> family -> genus
- Homology (shared ancestor) neq analogy (convergent evo)
- *Clade* is an entire subtree
- *Orthologous genes* were copied during speciation
- Some DNA change at consistent rate; *molecular clock*
- Horizontal gene transfer complicates
### Chap 27
Prokaryotes!
- Cell wall, and then capsule
- Circular chromosome, with circular plasmids
- No endo-membrones
- Flagella or cilia, plus pilus for occasional DNA donation
- DNA change also by phage or by absorbing environmental DNA
- Nutritional diversity with
	- photoautrophy (light, producer from air) e.g. cyanobacteria
	- chemoautotrophy (chemical energy, producer from air)
	- photoheterotrophy (light, consumer/consumer from organic material)
	- chemoheterotrophy (chemical, consumer/consumer from organic material)
- Bacteria (majority) plus Archea (lots of extremophiles)
- Helpful/harmful, also used for big pharma (bacteria)
### Chap 28
Protists!
- plastids were cyanobacteria descendents
- Most eukaryotes by species count are protists; there are four major groups
	- Excavates (modified mitochondria, unique flagella, inside rod)
	- SAR (DNA similarities lol)
	- Archaeplastida (plastids, i.e. algae and plants)
	- Unikonts (fungi, animals, + sisters e.g. amoeba, slime molds)
- Cyanobacteria are key ecosystem producers
### Chap 29
Plant evo 1
- Evolved from algae; protective layer of *sporopollenin* may have allowed going on land
- Plants have *cuticles, stomata*, algae don't have
- Mosses have *gametophytes*, gamete organisms, leading to alternating generations
- Ferns were the first tall plants; unseeded; had *vascular tissue* that can carry water against gravity
### Chap 30
Plant evo 2
- *Gymnosperms*: no shell around seeds
- *Angiosperms*: fruit, flowers, seeds, dandelion etc. Include monocot/eudicot/etc. Pollination is good.
### Chap 31
- All fungi are heterotrophs, can secrete enzymes
- Grow *hyphae* filaments to collect food, can become *mycelia* networks of branched hyphae
- Reproduce sexually *or* asexually, with spores
- Diverged from animals at unicellular flagellum ancestor
	- Chytrids: flagella spores
	- Zygomycetes: zygosporangium for sex
	- Glomeromycota: formed with plants
	- Ascomycetes: sexual spores in sacs, many asexual as well
	- Basidiomycetes: Elaborate fruiting with sexual spores
### Chap 32
- Animal def'n
	- Multicellular, heterotrophic, with regulatory genes determining some asymmetric *body plan*
	- Generally left/right, top/down symmetry, with ventral/dorsal and anterior/posterior
	- Embyro from one cell which divides, and (blastopore) folds in on itself to create digestive system
- Dipoblastic or Triploblastic (depending on # germ layers)
- Sponges, then shelled animals w/ digestive systems, then fish, then vertebrates mammals humans
- Larvae have distinct morphology from adults sometimes
### Chap 33
Invertebrates!
- Sponges: no tissues, just cells
- Cnidarians: stinging cells, diploblastic, radially symmetric, single-opening digestion
- Lophotrochozoans: DNA-linked, include some worms, mollusks
- Ecdysozoans: Roundworms, chitin exoskeletons, includes insects
- Deuterostomes: sea stars, sea urchins, fish/vertebrates
### Chap 34
Vertebrates! The intro says it all.
- Chordates have a *notochord*, a stiff, fibrous rod acting as basal skeleton, and a dorsal hollow nerve cord
- Vertebrates have a backbone
- Gnathostomes have jaws; tetrapods have limbs
- Amniotes have a terrestially adapted egg
- Mammals have hair and produce milk
- Humans, emerged 1-3MY ago, used tools, bipedal, large brain

- If not tetrapod, prolly fish
- If not amniote, amphibia
- If not mammal, then reptile
