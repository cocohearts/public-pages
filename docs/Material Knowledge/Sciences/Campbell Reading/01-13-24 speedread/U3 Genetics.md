### Chap 13
- Genes have loci, chromosomes come in pairs of sister chromatids
- Mitosis is asexual reproduction, or cell proliferation
- Human haploid number=23, diploid=46, there are 46 chromosomes each a pair of chromatids
- Meiosis: each chromosome pair combines/crosses and gets recombinated, and then split into two homologs -> split into four daughter cells/gametes
- Prophose/Metaphase/Anaphase I/II
### Chap 14
- Punnet squares, recessive/dominant alleles
- Since each person carries *two* versions of each chromosome (each pair of sister chromatids), etc.etc.
- "carriers", hereditary disease analysis etc.
### Chap 15
- Sex-linked genes (live on X,Y) inherit in their own way
- Linked genes, similar to each other, violate independent selection as predicted by Mendel
- Percentage of "recombinants" can indicated linkedness
- Aneuploidy is weird copying mistakes resulting in abnormal chromosome counts
- Genome imprinting, from DNA methylation, from only the mother
- Other disorders, e.g. mitochondria DNA issues
### Chap 16
- Experiments with phages, crystal spectroscopy determined the structure; AT/GC (AC-DC)
- Semiconservative replication:
	- Primase adds RNA primers
	- pol III adds in the 3'-5' direction (on bottom) on leading strand
	- pol I replaces RNA primers and Okazaki fragments with DNA
	- Rep. fork opened at the *origin*, held open by *helicase*
- Chromatin is made of DNA, histones
	- DNA width 2nm, becomes 10 after wrapping around histones, 30 in a "fiber", 300 in the loops which condense to 700 chromosome
### Chap 17
- Transcription from RNA polymerase, starts at promoter, TATA box 25 nucleotides before start
- *Transcription unit* refers to actual region
- RNA is spliced by spliceosome (a ribozyme) into *ex*pressed-ons and *in*tervening-trons (exons, introns)
- UTR acts as caps on the ends, for movement/protection/binding to ribosome
- Translation starts at methionine, ends at stop
	- More complex in eukaryotes; some enzymes chase the 5' end until transcription stops
- tRNAs map codons to amino acids, created at *aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase*
- Different kinds of mutations; missense, deletion, frameshift, nonsense etc.
### Chap 18
- Repressors, activators, which react to environment
- Activator/repressor can be turned on/off by binding to relevant proteins
- For prokaryotes: *Operon* consists of promoter, operator (interacts activator/repressor), and all coding regions for one pathway (grouped together)
- *Distal control elements* can bend around and help construct transcription factor, once activated
- *Coordinate control* can through hormones/other molecules/etc
- Post-transcription regulation through non-coding RNA (ncRNA) such as miRNA, siRNA, etc
- EVO-DEVO: determined->differentiated
	- Cells communicate/emerge through induction, signal molecules from direct contact
	- *Cytoplasmic determinants* are asymmetries in protein/mRNA distribution
	- first discovered is *bicoid*, in gradient from anterior to posterior
- Cancer results from *oncogenes*, control/avoid controlling cell cycle; multi-mutation model of cancer progression
### Chap 19
- Virus is nucleic acid surrounded by protein coat, *capsid* and sometimes *viral envelope*
- After DNA injection, two paths:
	- virulent (lytic cycle), make a bunch and kill/attack
	- temperate (lysogenic cycle), make a few and then coexist/inhabit for a while
- Defenses include CAS and proviruses
- Viruses can enter through broken cell walls
- Prions are slow-acting, self-replicating *proteins*, nearly indestructible
### Chap 20
- DNA sequencing by adding dRNA one at a time, flashes occur on binds
- PCR, using primase/polymerase/nucleotides/buffer to quickly copy fragments
- Restriction enzymes can make desire recombinant DNA, stitched together by *ligase*
- Hacking existing viral tech, like CRISPR
- Can un-differentiate cells by introducing certain proteins
### Chap 21
- *Systems biology* where *bioinfo* is used to study whole genes (*genomics*) and protein systems (*proteomics*)
- Repetitive DNAs that probably play structural roles in DNA
