### Chap 22
- Evolution, selection
- Convergent evolution
### Chap 23
- Several modes of genetic variation:
	- drift (just moves)
	- natural selection
	- flow (new population moves in)
- Several types of selection:
	- directional, stabilizing, disruptive (for a feature in one direction/to the middle)
	- Balancing
	- Sexual
### Chap 24
- Species def'd : largest group that can mate within itself sustainably
	- Allotropic speciation: gene flow is reduced, diff. evo changes
	- Sympatric: in the same environ, caused by sexual or habitat shifts
- Hybridization; effects of environ can merge species/keep them separate
### Chap 25
- Life came from:
	- abiotic organic molecules
	- hot surfaces polymerize
	- first life: self-replicating RNA
- Fossils mark evo history, using radiometric dating (carbon half-life)
- Large evolutionary events (*adaptive radiations*) catalyzed by global natural disasters (pruning many branches, creating more diversity), and geological movements
- Developmental genes (HOX) can create rapid body plan changes with small nucleotide changes
