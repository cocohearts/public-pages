### Chap 40
- No cell wall, need folded membranes for aqueous surface area for cells
- Organ systems -> organs -> tissues
	- Epitheliel tissue interfaces external/internal surfaces
	- Connective tissue binds and supports
	- Muscle tissue
		- Skeleta/striated, long fibers of merged cells yield stripes
		- Smooth muscle, for involuntary
		- Cardiac muscle, striated, but fibers relay signals and sync heart contraction
	- Nervous tissue
- Endocrine/hormone system, nervous system
- Thermoregulation: *endothermic* (from within) vs *ectothermic* (from outside)
- *Homeostasis* is the means by which smth is kept constant
- By surface/volume, metabolism rate per gram is *inversely* related to size
### Chap 41
- Essential nutrients include Amino acids, Fatty acids, Vitamins, Carbon chains, energy/ATP
- Feeding strategies: *bulk, filter, substrate, fluid*
- Compartmentalization (via blastopore), yields either
	- Gastrovascular cavity (goes in/out)
	- Alimentary canal (long path with sacs, allows parallel)
- Generally:
	- Mouth/esophagus adds saliva, careful involuntary engineering controls airway (trachea) closure, sphincter for esophagus opens
	- Gastric glands, tubes in the tissue of stomach, adds HCl, create mucus, secretions
	- In small intestine:
		- liver->bile in gallbladder->emulsifies fats
		- pancreas adds basic bicarbonate
		- *Villi* with hairs absorb nutrients
		- Chylomicron go into bloodstream
	- After small intestine goes to *colon* (recovers water) and *cecum* (ferments fibers)
	- *Rectum* holds shit until defecated
	- Herbivore cellulose digestion requires bacteria
	- Regulation through various hormones affecting liver/gallbladder/stomach secretions to intestin
	- Insulin increases glucose->cell uptake, glucagon decreases, both from pancreas
		- Diabetes I: insulin cells in pancrease destroyed by immune system
		- Diabetes II: insulin produced correctly, but cells fail to respond due to inactivity/diet
### Chap 42
- Arteries take blood away from heart, veins towards
- Capillaries are tighter areas, blood passes more slowly, more thin
- Marine invertebrates use *hemolymph* i.e. their blood is just the surrounding fluid
- Fish have one-pump heart, two spaces (one atra in, other ventricle out); reptiles have three (two atria in, one ventricle pushes out, alternating); mamals have *pulmonary circuit* (two suck in, two push out)
- Pulmonary artery/veins from heart to lungs; systemic arteries/veins from heart to system (four parts, each unique name)
- Like an engine, valves control everything
- Chemical gradients (again!) used to transfer O2, CO2 passively from air/blood, through epithelial cells
- Amphibians use *positive pressure*; birds use one-way *air sacs*; mammals expand rib/diaphragm using *negative pressure*
- More regulation through pH measures in aorta, arteries
### Chap 43
- Innate immunity:
	- Skin, lysozomes in acid/saliva/mucus/etc., *phagocytic cells* that combine with lysosomes, complement system proteins, interferons, etc. antimicrobial peptides
	- Histamine creates inflation, increasing immune cell access
- Adaptive immunity, run from system recognizing *antigens* outside pathogens
	- Lymphocytes, B/T cells; B have *antigen receptors*, it's a diceroll, find one that matches
	- Phagocyutes/B cells present the antigens on their boundary; helper T cells pick them up
	- Cytotoxic T cells match reported antigens and attack; antibodies bind to antigens marking phagocytosis (*humoral response*), complement system lysis
	- Antibodies lead to passive immunity/vaccines/etc
- Self-tolerance i.e. immune system attacks itself
	- HIV, resulting disease called AIDS, destroyed helper T cells
	- No such immune defense against cancer cells, only against viruses
### Chap 44
- Osmoregulation: maintaining ratios of solvents, waters, etc.
- Freshwater fish have salt transported out actively by gills, water comes in naturally; marine fish are opposite; terrestial vertebrates are a mix
- Nitrogenous wastes are important; ammonia is toxic, fish dispose directly, vertebates must synthesize into urea or uric acid (greater energy cost)
- Excretion through *filtration, reabsorption, secretion, excretion*. 
- Other types of animals don't have kidneys; all use tubules wrapped around blood and mix of osmosis/active transfer/selective permeability/blood pressure/osmosis
- Kidney is substructure with many *nephrons* (capillary-wrappers)
### Chap 45
- Endocrine, aka hormones; *paracrine* for neighbors, *autocrine* for self
- *Neurotransmitters* from nerve cells act locally; *neurohormones* go into blood; *pheromones* into the environment
- Polypeptides (insulin), steroids (all lipids), and *amines* are the three classes
- Water soluable bind to receptors; lipid-soluble pass through membrane into interior
- Endocrine starts from hypothalamus, posterior pituitary/anterior pituitary
- Endocrine is self-negative-feedback, neuroendocrine (such as oxytocin/opiate/epinephrine) is self-positive-feedback
- Long *hormone cascades* from hypothalamus to other parts
- Gonads are main source of sex hormones: androgens (e.g. testosterone) more in males, estrogens (e.g. estradiol), progesterones more in females
### Chap 46
- Diploid zygote
- Asexual, usually among females, sometimes precipitated by mating-like action; hermaphrodite, each fertilize the other
- Fertilization via *gonads*, all animals have; anatomically:
	- sperm produced in testes, stored in seminal vesicle, ejected by mascular vas deferens
	- eggs completed meiosis before birth, waiting in ovaries; after maturation move to uterus, next step depends on fertilization strategy
- *Spermatogenesis* in males (continuous), *oogenesis* in females (periodic)
### Chap 47
- Sperm/egg have small vesicles on boundary; sperm tip dissolves egg jelly wall, trigging Ca2+ wave across egg; cortical granule release in egg instigates fertilization envelope (blocking polyspermy)
- Then *cleavage*, splitting into ~100 blastomeres, creating *blastula* that has an asymmetric internal cavity; in mammals *blastocyst* embeds itself into uterus
- Gastrula -> membrane folds in on itself, tube goes all the way through, become digestive tract
- Membranes fold/pinch to create multiple *germ layers*:
	- Ectoderm, outer layer
	- Mesoderm, middle layer
	- Endoderm, innermost tissues/organs/digestion
- Notochord/neural cord
- *Organogenesis/morphogensis* occurs now
- Specific parts of blastula become specific body parts
### Chap 48
- Most of brain is *glial cells* wrapped around neuron, e.g. Schwann cells forming myelin sheath around axon
- Dendrites are receivers, synapses are senders
- Sensory neurons, interneurons, motor neurons
- Ion pumps of Na+, K+ create voltage difference, just like other cells
	- Pump exchanges Na+, K+, most Na+ gates closed, so inside Na+ concentration depressed; K+ gates are all open always, K+ concentration stays constant
- After signal received from synapse, binds to *ligand-gated ion channel*, ion gates open triggering Na+ inflow, then Ka+ outflow, bringing membrane potential back to resting potential
- *Action potential* is a brief actionable peak of potential; jumps from one *node of Ranvier* to the next along axon
### Chap 49
- Central nervous system is interneurons; peripheral NS is sensory/motor neurons
- Sensory -> afferent -> CNS -> efferent -> motor, autonomic -> sympathetic (excited), parasympathetic (cooldown, digestion), enteric (digestion, pancreas)
- Reactive neural circuits in spinal cord
- Brain three parts:
	- Forebrain: cerebrum (most visible part), thalamus (sensory traffic hub), hypothalamus (homeostasis, survival instincts)
	- Midbrain: goofy ahh sensory stuff, small for humans
	- Hindbrain: cerebellum (motor, sensor), pons/medulla oblongata (sensory hubs to cerebrum)
- Emotions dependent on *limbic system* (thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala) bordering brainstem
- Thinking happens on cerebral cortex *outside* of cerebrum, inside is *white matter*, connections/wires
- Hippocampus for working-memory temporary links, cerebral cortex for long-term
- Cortex has four sides; left is math/logic/language, right is pattern/nonverbal/"art"
- Higher thinking->wonkier more folded cortex
- Reshaping of connections is learning
- Schizophrenia is broken dopamine, addiction is broken reward system, Alzheimers is amyloid plaques, Parkinson's is death of dopamine-neurons
### Chap 50
- Sensory transduction from CNS -> motor system
- Mechano-, chemo- electromagnetic, thermo-receptors
- Invertabrates have *statocysts*, cilia balls with sand grains determining orientation
- Outer ear collects sound, middle ear in *tympanic membrane* (eardrum) transmits to bones of middle ear, through oval window to fluid in two bone canals contained in *cochlea*
- In between bone canals are hair cells that signal each time direction change
- Receptors can detect acceleration via viscous blobs of liquid moving around
- Vertebrate eye, a single eye with pigmented muscle-like *choroid*, exposed part is iris, choroid attached to suspensory ligaments contracts/relaxes to squeeze and move the lens
- Lens in front is *aqueous humor*, behind is *vitreous humor*
- Choroid surrounded by *sclera* and *cornea*, white stuff
- *Retina* inside choroid, all rod/cone/epithelial cells connected to bipolar signalers to neurons
- Light -> protein active -> channels open/close -> bipolar signalers have potential change -> signal
- Focusing area *fovea* mostly cones (color), can see sharp images; rods for seeing in the dark, more sensitive to light
- Taste through papilla on tongue, donut-like indentations into the muscle with taste buds embedded on the walls, taste buds have sensory receptors, are linked to neurons
- Smell is similar; olfactory receptor cells embedded in epithelial cells, with cilia that detect odorants in mucus
- Muscle -> bundle of fibers -> each fiber is own cell, with membrane -> contains myofibrils
- Each myofibril striated with sarcomeres segments; *thin actin filament* attached to sarcomere boundary, *thick myosin filament* in the middle
- Neurons signal gates to open releasing Ca+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum surrounding myofibril
- Ca+ exposes myosin binding sites, myosin grabs the actin and walks five times a second (via ATP phosphorylation protein shape change) along the actin creating contraction
- Energy burn ladder: ATP <- glucose <= glycogen <= oxygen limited; lactic acid ferment
- Smooth is just not striated, more uniform
- Skeletons exist lmao
### Chap 51
- *Behavior* defn'd responses to external/internal stimuli
- Learning happens through *imprinting* (of young animals), *cognition* (prediction), *associative learning* (experience), *social learning* (from others)
- Weird social behaviors explained by sexual competition/picking fit males; e.g. taking a mate that others have already taken
- Opposite; mating for life; altruism etc.
