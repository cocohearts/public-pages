### Already Mastered
- `h,l` for left, right
- `j,k` for down, up
- `y,p` for copy, paste
- combine as in `y3w`, use `p/P`
- `v` for visual
- `o,O` for open new line, after, before
- `i,a` obvious
- `w,b` known, capitalize for only whitespace no punc.
- `.` repeat, `;` next using find character `f`, `,` to find previous
- `>>,<<` for indents, pref with N to apply below lines
- `0,^,$` for line movement
- Use `/` to search, `n,N` for movement
- Use `?` to search backwards
- `i` for inner (no whitespace) e.g. `diw`, `a` for outer, also can do `diW` etc.
- `V` for visual by line
- `e` for word end
- `C,D` delete to end; `cc,dd` delete whole; but `Y,yy` are equiv.
- `A` for append to end of sentence
- `t` basically `fh`
- `%` to jump to matching `({[`
- `:reg` to see list of registers; `"1p` to paste yank before this, `"ayw` to yank word to `"a`
- `J` used to join selected lines with space delim
- `cs{sel}([` make a selection, replace surrounding `(` with `[`
- similarly `ds`, or `ys` to add
### Learning
-  `ge` for back word end
- `{,[(` for first new whitespace after last para
- `(,)` for `{` plus firstline para
- `gU<>,gu<>,~` for case (last toggle)
- `CTRL-O` to old positions, `CTRL-I` to new ones
- `CTRL-U`, `CTRL-D`
- use `q[x]` to record macro to key `[x]`
- `<UP>` to try previous searches from search history
- `m[x]` create mark, `'[x]` to go to mark
- `:grep` to use grep inside current file
- `s{char}{char}` v-sneak, can use op, in Obs just `cl`
- `]]` next `{` in first column; `[[` next `}` in first column
- `[(` for previous unmatched `(` and `[)` for next unmatched `)`; aka. previous/next in this "scope"
- `<CTRL-O>` for one-bullet hybrid Insert-Normal mode
- `<CTRL-R>` for paste from register in Insert mode (use with ctrl-o `:reg`)
- replace mode with `R`
### WTF
- `<CTRL-W> S/V` to split (horizontal line) or (vertical line)
- `<CTRL-W> h/j/k/l` to move windows
- `<CTRL-A>` to inc. next number
- `<CTRL-X>` to dec. next number
