Adenosine diphosphate + inorganic phosphate $\iff$ Adenosine triphosphate

Phosphates are negatively charged and stable, so ATPs hold lots of energy

Mitochondria has *inner membrane* which covered with ATP synthase-s, inside is Matrix, in between is inter-membrane space

ATP synthase powered by the wheel being turned by proton pump stuff

On each synthase, protons flow from intermembrane $\to$ egress

Glucose + 6O2 $\to$ 6 Carbon dioxide and 6 water

2H becomes 2H+ and 2e-, following *electron transport chain* producing ATP
NADH$\to$NAD+ pump protons *out* of the matrix, then the gradient turns the turbine which creates ATP
