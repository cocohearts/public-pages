### Hox genes revisisted
- Define body plan (master regulators, coordinate control etc.)
- Mutations can result in new body parts
### Cytoplasmic Determinants
- Proteins+mRNAs that *aren't* homogenous in *early divisions*, first differentiation
- E.g. bicoid mRNA makes bicoid protein which signifies the end

## Evo-Devo
- Evolutionary-Devolopmentary Bio
- E.g. C. elegans slomo; sperm/egg nucleus combine, and then split, but two resulting cells are *asymmetric*
