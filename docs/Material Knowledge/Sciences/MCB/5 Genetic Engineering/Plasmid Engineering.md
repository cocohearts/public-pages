- By differential centrifugation and PCR, get a bunch of bacterial plasmids (small DNA circles) and gene fragments coding for insulin
- Restriction enzyme (EcoR1 from E. coli) will cut DNA at GAATTC (between G and A) on both sides
- Mix in the desired insulin fragments with overlapping gaps; RNA will bind
- Add DNA ligase to seal the gaps

- Restriction Digestion Analysis: If both sides are cut with same restriction enzyme, then test with another restriction enzyme that's in the middle of the segment, to check for orientation

### Experimental Procedure
- After plasmids created, heatshock bacteria to absorb DNA; then reproduce, centrifuge, etc.
- Add an antibiotic resistance gene, and cull those who didn't take it with antibiotics
- Purify from individual colonies
- Finally, take out to check done correctly (locating restriction locations; can bar test)
