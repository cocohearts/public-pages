- Ribosomal subunits formed in nucleolus (small nuclear RNA)
- Transcription to mRNA from pre-mRNA in nucleus
- mRNA exits from pore in nucleus
- Small "red dots" in cytoplasm are ribosom\[al\] RNA, translate mRNA using tRNA
- Alternately, bound ribosomes on rough ER translate secreted proteins
- 

### Reminder on mutations
- Silent, Misssense (amino changes), Nonsense (STOP or START inserted)
- Change splicing
- Deletions/insertions can create *frameshifts* that create nonsense
