- DNA becomes mRNA, becomes protein through ribosome
## Replication OrdoOp
- Origin of replication: specific DNA marker, eukaryotes can have 100s
- "Bubbles" form at each origin, and they grow at both ends (called replication forks) until two strands
- Helicase at the rep. fork unwind and separate the DNA
 	- Synthesis started by mRNA *primer*
- DNA is separated into two strands, the two strands each get another complete DNA built on top of it
- Nucleotides added to 3' end
	- Polymerase adds triphosphate nucleotides to DNA
	- Pyrophosphates come off
	- Attached onto 3' end of strand
	- One strand grows directly, called *leading*
	- One strand grows in the opposite direction with
	- Okazaki fragments (RNA)
	- Attached to previous fragments by *ligase*
	- Changed into DNA by *pol 1*
- Polymerase-3 attaches to leading and adds nucleotides
	- Come in as triphosphates; pyrophosphate comes out
- Maintenance and stability
	- Sliding clamp keeps the two strands together
- Note the antiparallelity
### Polymerase

### Replication Correction
- Every 100k, wrong nucleotide matched
- First proofreading gets to every 10B
- If mistake persists, scanning proteins find "bulges" to get fixed by polymerase
### Telomerase
- The new strand in replication doesn't have stuff on it
- Each time duplication happens DNA gets shorter
- *Telomerase* rebuilds *telomeres* on the ends of DNA
