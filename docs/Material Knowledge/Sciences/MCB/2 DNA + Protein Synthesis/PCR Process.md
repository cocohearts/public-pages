### Lyse worms
- Place into lysis buffer (detergent and proteinase K)
- Frozen to crack open worms
- 60C to allow protein to break down cells and proteins in cells
- 95C for 15m to denature proteinase
### PCR
- Add Forward/Reverse Primer (length 18bp preferred)
- Master Mix (buffer, polymerase, nucleotides)
- As primer gets built, it's actually RNA (that means U and not T)
### Gel Electrophoresis
- Restriction enzymes cut DNA into bits at very specific locations, matching certain subseqs
- Each piece placed in gel with uniform electric potential field
- DNA phosphate negatively charged
- Large pieces will move more slowly towards positive side
- Bars on the gel can be revealed by staining and placing under UV
