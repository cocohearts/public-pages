## LWE assumption
Given $e$ drawn randomly from $\chi^{m}$ where $\chi=[-B,B],$ and some secret $s,$ then given a random matrix $A$ the pair
$$
(A,As+e)
$$
is indistinguishable from $(A,r)$ for some random $r$. In other words, "columnspace is dense, and after adding noise looks uniform."
## Secret-key using LWE
Then we can do secret-key encryption. Given a binary secret $s \in \mathbb{F}_{2}^{m},$ we draw some $e$ and return
$$
\left( A, As+e+\left\lfloor  \frac{q}{2}  \right\rfloor v \right).
$$
Then the vector is indistinguishable from a random. Given the secret, decrypt by subtracing $As$ and rounding.
## LHE using above
Since $q$ is odd, when we add instead of XOR there's an off-by-one. Also the range of $e$ grows. Hence we can do $d$ homomorphic encryption linear additions if $(B+1)d < \frac{q}{4}.$
## Encrypted database
We want private info retrieval, where I can retrieve information from the database without the server learning anything about what I was searching for. How can I keep the index of my data encrypted?

Use one-hot vectors for selection.
Use some secret key, use this secret key to encrypt the one-hot vector. Database multiplies the $D$ matrix by "public key" matrix $A$ and "private key" vector $As+e+\left\lfloor  \frac{q}{2}  \right\rfloor v_{j}.$
