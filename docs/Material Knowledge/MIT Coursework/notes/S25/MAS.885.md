learning to apply engineering principles to biology
- hierarchical composability
- standardized "parts"
- plug-and-play for manufacturing, etc. all kinds of stuff
### protein design part 1
- alpha helices, encouraged when gap of 3/4/7 have hydrogen bonding
- beta-sheets, bonds form between strands connecting into a sheet, side chains alternate
- beta-helix takes beta-sheets and it turns around an axis
### protein design part 2
- ml / dl based!
- there's a lot of techniquesâ€”gnn PorteinMPNN for struct2seq, RFDiffusion for func2struct, transformers (?) AlphaFold for seq2struct, MLM for protein modelling for downstream, etc.
- have a specific protein can try to denature it with a target (ubiquitous protein cutting), generate a structure that will bind to it, etc.
- design flow for de novo design:
	- pick a binding site to target
	- generate thousands of de novo structures
	- generate hundreds of thousands of sequences
	- verify, filter, simulate, etc. cut down to a hundred or so
- space for: new autoencoder for structure? how to encode 3d structure automatically?
### genetic circuits/gibson assembly
can hack genes, viruses, etc. explore 
gibson assembly
epigenetic editors
lots of crispr variants exist (eg crispr13 for rna)
hard to get crispr to hit without creating cancers
paradigm for viral genomic editing:
1. promoters - on switches
2. capsid - delivery vehicle
3. virtal auxiliary sequences - packaging
4. delivered gene - eg crispr system for editing
