learning to apply engineering principles to biology
- hierarchical composability
- standardized "parts"
- plug-and-play for manufacturing, etc. all kinds of stuff
### protein design part 1
- alpha helices, encouraged when gap of 3/4/7 have hydrogen bonding
- beta-sheets, bonds form between strands connecting into a sheet, side chains alternate
- beta-helix takes beta-sheets and it turns around an axis
### protein design part 2
- ml / dl based!
- there's a lot of techniquesâ€”gnn PorteinMPNN for struct2seq, RFDiffusion for func2struct, transformers (?) AlphaFold for seq2struct, MLM for protein modelling for downstream, etc.
- have a specific protein can try to denature it with a target (ubiquitous protein cutting), generate a structure that will bind to it, etc.
- design flow for de novo design:
	- pick a binding site to target
	- generate thousands of de novo structures
	- generate hundreds of thousands of sequences
	- verify, filter, simulate, etc. cut down to a hundred or so
- space for: new autoencoder for structure? how to encode 3d structure automatically?
