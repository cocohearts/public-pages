learning to apply engineering principles to biology
- hierarchical composability
- standardized "parts"
- plug-and-play for manufacturing, etc. all kinds of stuff
### protein design
- alpha helices, encouraged when gap of 3/4/7 have hydrogen bonding
- beta-sheets, bonds form between strands connecting into a sheet, side chains alternate
- beta-helix takes beta-sheets and it turns around an axis
