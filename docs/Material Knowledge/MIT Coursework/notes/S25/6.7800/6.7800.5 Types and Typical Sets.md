Typical set is all those sequences whose entropy is at most $T$ or close to $T.$ Weakly typical set for $p$ is linear family orthogonal to exponential through $p$ and $U.$ Divergence typical set $p|q$ is all distributions such that $D(p'||q)=D(p||q),$ which is linear family perp to exponential family through $p,q$.
