Typical set is all those sequences whose log likelihood wrt $y$ is close to $H(y).$ Divergence typical set $p|q$ is all distributions such that $D(p'||q)=D(p||q),$ which is linear family perp to exponential family through $p,q$. Weakly typical set for $p$ is linear family orthogonal to exponential through $p$ and $U.$ 

>[!important] Cramer's Theorem
>Given iid samples $y_{i}$, statistic $t,$ then
>$$\lim_{N \to \infty } -\frac{1}{N} \log \mathbb{P}\left[  \overline{t(y_N)}\geq \gamma\right] =D(q(\cdot;x)||p)=E_{C}(\gamma).$$
Here $q$ is in the exponential family with $p$ with sufficient statistic $t(y)$, such that EV of $t$ is $\gamma$. Note that $E_{C}$ is indeed increasing.

Note that $E_{C}(\overline{y_{N}})=0,$ as expected.

By definition, log likelihood under $p$ is at most $2^{-N(H(p)-\epsilon)},$ so you get corresponding bounds on set size. Furthermore, for any compact set, the log-likelihood of drawing a sequence from that set is dominated by the projection $q$ minimizing $D(q||p)$.

Given data $s,$ log-likelihood under model $p$ is $\sum_{i} \log p(s_{i}).$ Averaging over whole sequence gives
$$
\sum_x \hat{s}(x) \log p(x) = -D(\hat{s}||p) - H(\hat{s}).
$$
Clearly, once $s$ is fixed, the best generator is $\hat{s}.$ Hence $\epsilon$-typical sequences of $s$, those with $D(\hat{s}||p)$ within $\epsilon,$ have likelihood of at least $2^{N(-H(\hat{s})-\epsilon)}$
