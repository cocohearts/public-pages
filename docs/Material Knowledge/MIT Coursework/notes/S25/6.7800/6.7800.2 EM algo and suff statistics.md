## Sufficient statistics
Defined by a Markov chain, or by a conditional independence, or by equality in a Bayesian setting (i.e. conditional independence).

Given $x$ parameterizing a model that generates data $y,$ we say $s(y)$ is sufficient iff. $\mathbb{P}(x|y)\equiv \mathbb{P}(x|s(y)).$ Equivalently:
- all info we gain about $x$ from $y$ is expressed in $s$
