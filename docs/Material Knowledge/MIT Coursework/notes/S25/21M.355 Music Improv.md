talked about
- louis armstrong and bechet, harmonic forms, swingin' and blues'ing
- armstrong transformed into solo vibes
* charlie parker, line motifs
* miles davis, blues scale
* bebop scale (down) mixolydian scale (up) pentatonic for the faster "bebop sound"; bebop is 8 notes, perfect for 4bar eighths
- bebop is major with b7 inserted
- mixolydian is dominant scale/chord
- classic tricks: turnarounds (b9 / #7 / tonic), tritones
* classic 12-bar blues (all dom. 7ths):
	* I, IV, I, I, IV, IV, I, I, V, IV, I, V
* jazzy, bluesy sounds (#11/b5, #9) vs more bebop sounds vs more diatonic classic sounds
- whole tone conveniently has tritone and #5 / b13 (as used by monk)
* from "traditional jazz" (30s, parker, lester young) to blues/bebop to sonny rollins (focusing more on band arrangement/composition, theme) 50s
- can also include #11 on "each chord" in blues as smth interesting to think abt?

new theory
- "tritone substitution" on dominant chord—dominants rooted at each diminished arpeggio tone have voice leading into tonic
- namely Db B F -> C C E

after bebop (2-5-1, fast, flashy, rhythmic) came a form of modal jazz, sticking to one chord and improvising together under a dynamic set of “vibes” under coltrane, miles davis; would reharmonize etc
pentatonics (12356), moving, focusing on certain chords / motifs

ornette coleman and don cheri came up w improvising off a single melody melody, moving keys, the three of them would just work by themselves

in the 80s came the young lions, sharp and bebop-flavored but had a focus on respecting long jazz tradition, playing swingy like bird, a lil bluesy like miles, combining all kinds of things

so like

ragtime
swing
big band
fusion
modal
contemporary

in the actual act of improv
harmony movement can be thoguht of as subtle movement / shift
but can be made more / less explicit by focusing on the one note in the scale that shifts
doing this in a series makes it really chromatic

so couple ways of seeing:
- harmonic movement
- weird intervals like minor, tritone
- chromatic movement
eg minor third in blues scales, or tritone shift

for milestones:
Gm7: want to emphasize blues-ish and the minor third fs, G Bb D F, "natural key" is like Bb or Fmaj
Fmaj7: F A C E, Fmaj
Am7: A C E G, natural key is C

so once again moving in dominants
if tritone sub, the way to go would be Bb then B then C

on clarinet (where it's Am7 Gmaj7 Bm7):

A B C D E ==F#== G A
G A B C D E ==F== G
B ==C#== D E ==F#== G A B

remember to hit chord tones on downbeats

recall that here, my tonic is A, so the bridge in Bm7 is actually sorta in A

note also that miles makes a point of not touching the F in the A sections
only touching C# in the bridge and only when necessary
