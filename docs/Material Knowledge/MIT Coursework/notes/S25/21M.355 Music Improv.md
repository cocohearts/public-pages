talked about
- louis armstrong and bechet, harmonic forms, swingin' and blues'ing
- armstrong transformed into solo vibes
* charlie parker, line motifs
* miles davis, blues scale
* bebop scale (down) mixolydian scale (up) pentatonic for the faster "bebop sound"; bebop is 8 notes, perfect for 4bar eighths
- bebop is major with b7 inserted
- mixolydian is dominant scale/chord
- classic tricks: turnarounds (b9 / #7 / tonic), tritones
* classic 12-bar blues (all dom. 7ths):
	* I, IV, I, I, IV, IV, I, I, V, IV, I, V
* jazzy, bluesy sounds (#11/b5, #9) vs more bebop sounds vs more diatonic classic sounds
- whole tone conveniently has tritone and #5 / b13 (as used by monk)
* from "traditional jazz" (30s, parker, lester young) to blues/bebop to sonny rollins (focusing more on band arrangement/composition, theme) 50s
- can also include #11 on "each chord" in blues as smth interesting to think abt?

new theory
- "tritone substitution" on dominant chord—dominants rooted at each diminished arpeggio tone have voice leading into tonic
- namely Db B F -> C C E

after bebop (2-5-1, fast, flashy, rhythmic) came a form of modal jazz, sticking to one chord and improvising together under a dynamic set of “vibes” under coltrane, miles davis; would reharmonize etc
pentatonics (12356), moving, focusing on certain chords / motifs

ornette coleman and don cheri came up w improvising off a single melody melody, moving keys, the three of them would just work by themselves

in the 80s came the young lions, sharp and bebop-flavored but had a focus on respecting long jazz tradition, playing swingy like bird, a lil bluesy like miles, combining all kinds of things

so like

ragtime
swing
big band
fusion
modal
contemporary
