Autoencoder/decoder: bottleneck with reconstruction loss
Prediction with imputation (infilling) or filling in patched pixels
Clustering: typical stats tool, $K$-means clustering; partition into $K$ clusters, minimize distance to mean of cluster. Instead of bottleneck by hypersphere, bottleneck by integers
