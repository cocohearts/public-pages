We want something that is graph invariant, i.e. given adjacency matrix, it should be invariant to node permutations.

Similar to CNNs, each node "listens to" i.e. interactions with its neighbors.

Algo for node $v$ for certain stage:
### Aggregate
- MLP $M_{1}(h_{v},h_{u})$ for every neighbor $u$ of $v$
- Sum all $M_{1}$ MLPs and run through $M_{2}$
- Maybe normalize wtv.
### Update
- MLP $M_{3}(h_{v},m_{v})$ to get the new encoding

All aggregates use the same MLP for each edge, all updates use same MLP for each pair (encoding, intermediate aggregate).

Update just "locks in" all the relevant changes.
