## Data
- Make sure you preprocess correctly
- Test loading thoroughly (einops)
- Much of the work is reshaping tensorsâ€”make sure you do it correctly
- Augmentation
- Tradeoff axes:
	- Dimension
	- Generalization
	- Cost
- Levers:
	- Augmentation
	- Associated data
## Models
- Don't work too hard
	- Simple models can have unseen advantages (clearer advantages)
	- Translate to other solved problems
## Other tricks
- Know your constants: ln(0.5)=-0.69, ln(0.1)=-2.3
- Adding tricks is like cooking. Takes intuition, time, practice, etc. to figure out what to do
