- Resistors, voltage/current Kirchoff's laws
- Battery, ground, voltage vs. current
## Important Components
- Diode
	- Silicon diode: .7 volts
	- Germanium diode: .3 volts
	- LED: 2-3 volts
	- Current only goes forwards, acts as fixed voltage drop when passes through, open wire when none
- Capacitor
	- Used in signal processing; acts as closed wire for "high-frequency" signals (cancel out), open wire for "low-frequency" signals
	- If placed in series with the load, becomes high-pass filter (only high frequency passes, low cancelled out)
	- If placed in parallel, becomes low-pass filter (only low frequency passes, high goes to ground)
- BJT - Bipolar Junction Transistor
	- Base, Emitter, Collector
	- Base acts as "control", collector current must be fixed $\approx70$ multiple of base current, exits through emitter
	- Enables "op-amps" (draws power source, amplifies difference between +/-) which uses BJT, voltage splitter
		- resistors at base, collector to control voltage/current ratios
		- voltage drop across collector resistor is fixed product of voltage drop across base resistor
		- take output voltage after collector resistor, before the transistorâ€”is a clipped inverted multiple of input voltage
- MOSFET - Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor
	- when voltage passes through metal gate, turns on the semiconductor
	- p-mosfet connects source to drain when gate is above source
	- n-mosfet connects source to drain when gate is below source
- Motors
	- when two magnets aren't aligned, there is some force pushing them together
	- brush magnets have four electromagnet coils each at 90 degs
	- current flows through brushes attached to the axle
	- as the axle spins it activates the coil normal to the axle magnet
	- ideal model:
		- calculates a constant from torque, voltage, and angular velocity
