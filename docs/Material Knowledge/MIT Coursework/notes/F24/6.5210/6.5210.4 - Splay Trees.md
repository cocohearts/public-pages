Typical BBST
- Auxiliary info track (or correlate to) heights
- Rotate to re-balance when heights are to far off (large subtree deep in tree)

Consider the "worst" example with a left-chain to smallest value $x$. Then to bring $x$ to the top we rotate node by node. This has some bad stuff—the resulting tree is still a long chain.

## Fundamental Double Rotations
We want to rotate $x$ up two levels. Going up take $y,z$.
- If same direction ($x<y<z$) do single rot at y then x, so that $x,y,z$ now go down in the other direction, and subtrees are swapped.
- If zigzag ($z>y$, $y<x$) then rot $x$ then rot $z$, so that $x$ is root and $y,z$ are children.

Then we define *Splay($x$)* defined as
- use `double rot` plus maybe a `single rot` to move $x$ to root
Search is defined as usual
- Left, right etc.
- Splay to root

## Amortized Analysis
Take weights $w_{x}$ for each node (in example set to $w_{x}=1$). Then let 
- $s(x)$ be sum of weights in subtree,
- $r(x)=\log_{2}(s(x))$.

Finally, use
$$
\phi:=\sum_{x}r(x).
$$
> *Access Lemma*
> Amortized time to splay $x$ to root $t$ is at most
> $$3(r(t)-r(x))+1.$$

We just examine each operation—zigzig and zigzag—to verify the lemma. We want to show $cost \leq 3(r'(x)-r(x))$ and then can telescope.

### Zigzig
The real cost of double rot is $2$, and $\Delta \phi=\sum_{x,y,z}\Delta r(k)$. Note that $r'(x)=r(z),$ so then we get
$$
\begin{align*}
2+\Delta \phi
&= 2+r'(y)+r'(z)-r(x)-r(y)\\
&\leq 2+r'(x)+r'(z)-r(x)-r(x)\\
&=2+r'(z)-r(x) + (r'(x)-r(x)).\\
\end{align*}
$$
Then
$$
2+r'(z)+r(x)=\log_{2}(2s'(z))+\log_{2}(2s(x))\leq 2\log_{2}(s'(z)+s(x))\leq 2\log_{2}(s'(x)).
$$
Hence
$$
2+\Delta \phi\leq 3(r'(x)-r(x)).
$$
### Zigzag
> Exercise to the reader.

## Nice Properties
We can just get certain properties for free by picking the weights $w$.
### Info-theory mumbo jumbo
Splay trees are good for high-query situations. If items are queried a lot they should be closer to the top.

Idea is that you should do $\log p$ work for items accessed $p$ of the time.Splay tree does this well, called "static optimality".
### "Finger splay tree"
If we start with a finger at node $f$, set $w_{x}=\frac{1}{1+(\Delta r)^{2}}$ and we get the property we want.
### Working set
Set $w_{x}=\log(\text{distinct items accessed})$ and more recent items cost less.

For any given task we just set the weights $w_{x}$ to what we want.

Technically the non-constant weights $w_{x}$ means we have to re-derive parts of the Access Lemma proof, but otherwise it's the same.
