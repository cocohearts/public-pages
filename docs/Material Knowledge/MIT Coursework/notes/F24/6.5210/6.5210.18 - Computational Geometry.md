## Orthogonal Range Queries
Given points in $\mathbb{R}^{n},$ how do we find all points in some axis-aligned box in $O(A+\log n)$ time, where $A$ is the answer?

- Assume $2^{n}$ points
- Create data structure for each "block" of length power of 2
- e.g. 2D case
	- break $x$-interval into $\log n$ preprocessed slabs
	- Each preprocessed slab is BST of $y$-coordinates
Total space taken is $O(n\log n).$ Our construction cost is $O(n\log ^{2}n).$ Query cost is $O(\log ^{2}n).$ In general it's $\log ^{d}n.$
