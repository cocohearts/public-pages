## Analysis
### Framing
1. "Gross flow" with nonnegative $g(v,w)$ along *directed edges* for adjacent vertices $v,w$, we always consider $g(v,w)-g(w,v)$, we have 
2. "Directed net flow" that can have negative numbers along edges with both *min* and *max*, only considers $g(v,w)$ with skew symmetry
### Decomposition
- Given a flow, take edges out of source iteratively
- Decompose flow into complete paths and cycles
### Verify if a Flow is Maximal
- Take *residual graph* where each edge has new bounds
- This graph has 0 flowâ€”take all points we can reach from source, this creates a cut with value 0
## Algorithms
Repeatedly look at residual, find augmenting path.
Assuming integers with capacities $\leq U$, we get at most $EU$ path sums.
