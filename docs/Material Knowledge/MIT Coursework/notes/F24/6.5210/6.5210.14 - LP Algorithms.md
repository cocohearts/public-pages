## Simplex Method
Start with standard form $Ax=b,$ make columns independent by removing redundant stuff (values in $b$ had better match up).

Any set of $m$ columns (basis) yields one intersection, then check feasibility and optimality. (grab a vertex)

If more than $m$ planes pass through vertex, we can discard until $m$ remain. Then all $m-1$ subsets determine an edge. Collect all hyperplanes that touch chosen vertex, then look over all edges; one such edge must increase objective (this can be shown since all differentials are convex combo. of edges), then walk across. Called *pivoting* because set of $m$ changes by one element.

Specifically in standard formulation, involves walking around the edges of the hyperplane $Ax=b.$

1992 bound: $m^{\log n}$ or $2^{n}m.$
## Ellipsoid method
Reduce to finding feasible of $Ax\leq b$ by taking primal with dual.

Take a very large ellipsoid that covers entire space, then
- want center of ellipsoid to lie in $P$
- Take two ellipsoid covers of large ellipsoid, check each cover
- Cover necessarily has volume $V_{1}\leq(1-k)V_{0}$, so is polynomial in *length* of inputs (because of log stuff)

## Interior point method
Have a "loss function" defined by distance from the walls (log of $Ax-b$) plus actual objective $cx$ 
Then gradient descent/cont. optimization on this thing
