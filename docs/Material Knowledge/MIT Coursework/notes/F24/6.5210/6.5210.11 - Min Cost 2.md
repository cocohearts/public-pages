Ok, so we now know optimality for min cost problemâ€”no negative cycles. We've got the min cost circulation formulation. How to do?

Max flow, then solve MCC (min cost circulation). Alternatively:
## Shortest Augmenting Path
First, clear all existing negative cycles.

Then each time we add the AP with lowest cost, and send maximal flow down said path. This cannot create any additional negative cycles:
- If it does, said cycle must go "backwards" along existing path, take the complement of intersection in cycle
- Alternatively, use price function; because we're augmenting a shortest path, a previously feasible price function stays feasible

### Algorithms for finding SAP
Naively, we run Bellman Ford $mU$ times, to get total cost $O(mnF)\leq O(m^{2}nU).$

We can do better; run Bellman Ford once to get all shortest paths, then reduced costs $d_{uv}'=d_{suv}-d_{sv}$ are all nonneg so we can just use Dijkstra's. We can keep using this because as we augment prices don't change; only capacities change. This yields $O(mF)\leq O(m^{2}U).$

Now let's do scaling to get true polynomial time. When scaling with adds to negative cost arcs, we begin by saturating all negative cost arcs and adding supply/demands, so that all edges become nonnegative cost and we can use Dijkstra's. Then $U$ is set to $1$ but we run this algorithm $\log U$ times so we get $O(m^{2}\log U)$ time.
