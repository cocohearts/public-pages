Algos that react to inputs a little bit at a time.

## Examples
*Ski rentals*: each day I choose to ski or not to ski, I can choose to rent at cost $1$ or buy at cost $T$. *Competitive analysis* is the best my algorithm can do vs opt against an adversary that is picking the sequence. If my algorithm is to rent $T$ times before buying, get a factor of 2.

*Finance*: suppose I'm selling a car, and bids come in within some range $[m,M].$ I know when the last offer is. Let $\phi=\frac{M}{m}.$

Deterministically I can take the first offer above $\sqrt{ mM },$ if I take then I'm at most $\sqrt{ \phi }$ below the max, and if I never take the max is at most $\sqrt{ mM }$ so last offer is at most $\sqrt{ \phi }$ below the max.

Randomly I can pick a power of 2 cutoff price from $[m,M]$ so I have $\frac{1}{\log \phi}$ chance of being within $2$ of the best. Then my expected selling price is at least on the order of $\frac{1}{\log \phi}$ of the best.

*Scheduling*: for the problem $P||\max C_{j}$ (no constrains, minimax load) assign each job to the least currently loaded machine. Take largest-load machine $M_{}$ with last job $p.$ Then all other loads are at least $M_{}-p$ so opt is at least $\frac{{m(M-p)+p}}{m}=M-p+\frac{p}{m},$ and also $opt\geq p,$ so $opt\left( 2-\frac{1}{m} \right)\geq M.$

*Paging*: we have memory and a cache, whenever we miss we have to evict and pay a price. Online algorithm is really about picking which item to evict.

*Deterministic Paging*
- Last in First out
- First in First out
- Flush when full
- Least frequently used
- Least recently used
LIFO, LFU not competitive

Lower bound: no online algorithm beats $k$-competitive. Have a $k+1$-page adversary that just calls whichever page is not in the cacheâ€”faults every time. But offline algorithm can lookahead and evict whichever page is not included in the next $k$ queries. This offline algorithm called Longest Forward Distance is optimal.
*Randomized Paging*
All pages start unmarked, when evicting pick random unmarked page and mark new page. Sort of like randomized FIFO. Fiat marking, $\log k$-competitive.

### Types of Adversaries
- *oblivious* knows probability distribution but not the tosses, probabilistic opt
- *adaptive* knows tosses up to now
- *fully adaptive* knows all tosses, might as well play best determinstic
