We introduced BFS (intersection of $n$), vertex (not lin. comb), extreme (unique opt. for some $c$) last time. Clear that
- not BFS -> not vertex (find subspace)
- not vertex -> not extreme (take lin. comb)
BFS to extreme is more difficult.

Given a BFS, transform to normal form so that the $n$ tight equalities/inequalities become $x_{i}\geq 0.$ Then we take our objective to be $\sum x_{i}.$ Clearly unique opt., since any other feasible point must have some $x_{i}>0.$

## Examining the Dual
Take $\min cx$ such that $Ax=b, x\geq 0.$ Then for any $y$ satisfying $yA\leq c$ componentwise, for any feasible $x$ we get
$$yb=y(Ax)=(yA)x\leq cx,$$
i.e. $yb$ is always at most $cx$. Then we get *weak duality*. 
> [!important] Dual of Standard LP
> The dual of $$\min c^{\dagger}x \colon Ax=b, x\geq 0$$ is $$\max b^{\dagger}y\colon A^{\dagger}y\leq c.$$

The claim to *strong duality* is that $\max yb=\min cx.$
### Physics Proof of Strong Duality
Given a ball touching a bunch of walls, we have normal forces $A_{i}$ with magnitude $x_{i}$ all touching a ball, with resulting force $b$. Reorient so that the objective function becomes $y$-height.

Ball must have net force $b$ and nonnegative force from the walls ($x_{i}\geq_{}0$).

## Complementary Slackness
Change our dual to
$$\max b^{\dagger}y\colon A^{\dagger}y+s= c, s\geq0.$$
Then note that when constraints are satisfied,
$$c^{\dagger}x-b^{\dagger}y=(A^{\dagger}y+s)x-b^{\dagger}y=(y^{\dagger}A)x+sx-y^{\dagger}(Ax)=sx,$$
so at $opt$ we must have $sx=0.$ Hence $s_{i}x_{i}=0 \,\forall i$ so either $x_{i}=0$ or $A_{i}^{\dagger}y=c_{i}.$

In the generalized case, if $x_{i}$ is UIS then 
TBD
