Start with two different framings.
> [!important] Canonical LP formulation
> Maximize the *linear objective* $c^{\dagger}x$ under the component-wise *linear constraint* $Ax\leq b$.

> [!important] Standard LP formulation
> Minimize the *linear objective* $c^{\dagger}x$ in the *affine space* $Ax=b$ under the *nonnegative constraint* $x\geq 0$.

Convert between by writing $x=x^{+}-x^{-}$ for $x^{*}\geq 0.$ Canonical is useful for theory (less moving parts), standard is better for algorithms.

Do some bashing (Cramer's det. rule, Gaussian elim., size checks, etc.) show we can check $Ax=b$ in polynomial time.

## Vertex intuition
- *Vertex*: point that is not convex combo of two others
- *Extreme point*: unique solution for some objective $c$
- *Basic feasible point*: tight intersection of $n$ half-planes and feasible
These are equivalent.

Then opt must be at a BFS, if it exists. 

## Decision problem
Checking if opt. can do by
- provide BFS achieving opt.
- take the half-spaces of $c^{\dagger}x=k$ forced by each of the linear constraints
- show has point solution
