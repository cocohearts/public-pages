### Min Cost
New paradigm: each edge has a *cost* so that the cost of the total flow is $c(e)f(u)$. Then the goal is to maximize flow (first) while minimizing flow (second).

We can translate MCF to Min Cost Circulation, i.e. no source/sink. The algorithm is just to take residual of maxflow, and then pick a min cost circulation to add on top.
### Min Cost Circulation
Just repeat Bellman-Floyd (finding negative cycles) and augment circulation.
### Prices
Let's add a market at each node. Each node offers a price to buy/sell at.
It's stable when no traffickers can make a profit, i.e. $\Delta_{v,w} p\leq d(v,w)$.

Then define "reduced cost" $c_{p}(vw)=c(vw)+p(v)-p(w)$, cost to buy at $v$, ship, and sell at $w$. All reduced costs should be $0$ along shortest paths, and positive along inoptimal paths.

Price function is *feasible* if (residual) graph if all arcs have nonnegative cost, i.e. there is no profit game. Notably, reduced cost path prices are just constant function of normal path prices (for fixed $s,t$).

Circulation is optimal cost (i.e. when added to max flow, is best circulation) iff. exists feasible price function. If unoptimal, there must be a negative cycle, i.e. shipping will always print money.
