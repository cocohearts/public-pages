### External Memory
- Have some large dataset with size $N$ in "external memory" (disk)
- Memory is chunked into blocks of length $B,$ each of which takes $O(1)$ to read into/write from internal memory with size $M$
- Operations in internal memory are assumed to be free
Examples:
- Matmul, by loading submatrices with side length $\sqrt{ M }$
- Sorted linked list, by keeping auxiliary data about segment in each block
- B-trees which grab all children on one read

However, we want to be cache-size oblivious.
### Divide-and-Conquer
is nice lol, will auto-size
